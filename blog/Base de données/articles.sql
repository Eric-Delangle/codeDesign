No, wait, the other thing: tedious. Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree. Daddy Bender, we\'re hungry. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px 0px 0.5em; line-height: 1.5; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8); font-family: Roboto, \'Helvetica Neue\', sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: #ffffff;\">Bender?! You stole the atom. Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Ugh, it\'s filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we\'re at it? Well, then good news! It\'s a suppository.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px 0px 0.5em; line-height: 1.5; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8); font-family: Roboto, \'Helvetica Neue\', sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: #ffffff;\">Shut up and take my money! I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. It\'s a T. It goes \"tuh\". When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought \"Why should I?\" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px 0px 0.5em; line-height: 1.5; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8); font-family: Roboto, \'Helvetica Neue\', sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: #ffffff;\">Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book \'Earth in the Balance\'\', and the much more popular \'\'Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth\', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px 0px 0.5em; line-height: 1.5; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8); font-family: Roboto, \'Helvetica Neue\', sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: #ffffff;\">Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book \'Earth in the Balance\'\', and the much more popular \'\'Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth\', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px 0px 0.5em; line-height: 1.5; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8); font-family: Roboto, \'Helvetica Neue\', sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: #ffffff;\">Oh, I think we should just stay friends. Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I\'m still single? It\'s \'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! Also Zoidberg. It doesn\'t look so shiny to me.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px 0px 0.5em; line-height: 1.5; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8); font-family: Roboto, \'Helvetica Neue\', sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: #ffffff;\">If rubbin\' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don\'t wanna be right. I saw you with those two \"ladies of the evening\" at Elzars. Explain that. Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money!</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px 0px 0.5em; line-height: 1.5; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8); font-family: Roboto, \'Helvetica Neue\', sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: #ffffff;\">Oh, I don\'t have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. Take me to your leader! Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers?</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: inherit; margin: 0px 0px 0em; line-height: 1.5; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8); font-family: Roboto, \'Helvetica Neue\', sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: #ffffff;\">Leela, Bender, we\'re going grave robbing. No, just a regular mistake. That\'s right, baby. I ain\'t your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him! Actually, that\'s still true.</p>', '2019-07-12');
